## **📌 Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment trends using structured **SQL queries**. It includes:  
✅ **Sentiment Distribution Analysis** (Positive, Neutral, Negative)  
✅ **Platform-wise Sentiment Comparison** (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)  
✅ **Time-Based Sentiment Trends** (Tracking sentiment variations over time)  
✅ **User Engagement Analysis** (Finding top users based on comments)  

The dataset was **synthetically generated** using Python libraries (`pandas`, `random`), making it ideal for SQL-based data analysis projects.

---

## **📌 SQL Features Used**  
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` for data aggregation  
- `AVG()`, `COUNT()` for calculating engagement stats  
- `ROUND()` to format numerical data  
- `COALESCE()` to handle missing values  
- `WITH ROLLUP` to generate total summaries  
- `LIMIT` to extract key insights  

---

## **📊 Sample SQL Queries**  

### **1️⃣ Sentiment Distribution Across Platforms**  
```sql
SELECT platform, sentiment, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM user_sentiment 
GROUP BY platform, sentiment 
ORDER BY platform, count DESC;
```

### **2️⃣ Top 10 Most Active Users**
```sql
SELECT Username, COUNT(*) AS Comment_Count 
FROM user_sentiment
GROUP BY Username
ORDER BY Comment_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **3️⃣ Average Rating Per Sentiment**
```sql
SELECT sentiment, ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS Avg_Rating  
FROM user_sentiment     
GROUP BY sentiment    
ORDER BY Avg_Rating DESC;
```

## **📂 Dataset Details**
- The dataset contains **synthetic user sentiments**.
- It is stored in **`user_sentiment.sql`**, which can be executed in MySQL/PostgreSQL.
- The `sentiment.py` script creates **realistic sentiment data**.

### **👀 Sample Data**
| ID | Username | Platform  | Sentiment | Rating | Timestamp |
|----|---------|----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| 1  | Alice   | LinkedIn | Positive   | 4.8    | 2024-03-10 10:30 |
| 2  | Bob     | Instagram| Neutral    | 3.2    | 2024-03-10 11:00 |
| 3  | Charlie | Twitter  | Negative   | 1.5    | 2024-03-10 11:30 |
